        <p>The pandemic is impacting all of us in different ways, many of which could affect your participation in class.

If at some point during this semester the pandemic impacts your ability to participate in class or meet assignment deadlines, please contact me as soon as possible. While I donâ€™t need to know all of the details of your circumstances, knowing as early as possible that you are experiencing challenges can help me connect you to college resources that can provide support</p>

    <section>
      <h4><u>Software Requirements</u></h4>
      <p>The student will need to have access to a text editing software application in order to construct CSS styles. The Notepad application will be adequate for writing CSS. However using Notepad Plus would be a better alternative because it uses code coloring which helps greatly. If you are currently enrolled in the HTML & Dreamweaver class then using Dreamweaver would be a much better alternative.</p>
